## Awarm: Privacy Policy

Welcome to Awarm app for Android, developed by Narify apps.

This is an open source Android app developed by Amr Salah Abdelhady. The source code is available on GitHub and the app is also available on Google Play.

I take privacy very seriously. I know how bad it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge and permission.

This app does not collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences (like theme, etc.) and alarms) created by the user is stored on their device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by the app, or have any question regarding how the app protects your privacy, please contact us:
